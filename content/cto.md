## [Promoted your best developer to manager? Congratulations. You just destroyed two careers. by Matt Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7383869700407156736/)

> Engineers optimize for code quality. 
> Managers optimize for human potential. 
> These are fundamentally different skill sets.

## [I once watched a team's velocity drop by half after hiring their best engineer. by Alex Di Mango](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7394650736007045120/)

> Teams don't scale through individual brilliance. They scale through collective momentum.

> The engineers who actually multiplied output never looked like rockstars.
> They wrote boring, obvious code that anyone could maintain.
> They approved pull requests that were good enough, not perfect.
> They spent time pairing with people who were stuck instead of cranking out features alone.

> His performance review was unremarkable. His impact was everywhere.

## [Changing Thoughts on Good Developers by 이동욱 (Translated from Korean)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/%EB%8F%99%EC%9A%B1-%EC%9D%B4-575160177_2019%EB%85%84%EC%97%90-eo%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C-%EC%B4%AC%EC%98%81%ED%95%B4%EC%A3%BC%EC%8B%A0-%EC%9D%B8%ED%84%B0%EB%B7%B0%EC%97%90-%EB%8C%80%ED%95%B4%EC%84%9C-%EC%A7%80%EA%B8%88%EB%8F%84-%EB%A7%8E%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%A4-%EB%AC%B8%EC%9D%98-%EC%A3%BC%EC%8B%A0%EB%8B%A4-activity-7345234203271143424-aHmR)

> Focusing on individual traits like "characteristics of a good developer" or "personalities suited for developers" turned out to be meaningless.
> What really mattered was "which developer, with what strengths and weaknesses, works at which company, and in what situation."

> - Developers who struggle to go deep into a single technology often thrive in early-stage startups, quickly building a variety of products as the company pivots.
> - Friends who found coding less appealing but had no trouble with presentations and documentation became ace in traditional large companies, excelling at both implementation and reporting in various situations.
> - A team member I once urged to study more development turned out to be an indispensable morale booster for the team.
> - An organization that only hired developers focused solely on technical skills ended up never holding any knowledge-sharing sessions.

## [When a Highly Competent Employee Says They Want to Quit by Yurim Jin (Translated from Korean)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hellojayjin_ssqreuqpktxutqaqzc-activity-7330544641903075328-ShBd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABSjspgBLaworIQjzZyO5CJmXIsDApO0tOU)

> 1. When a highly competent employee says they want to quit
>     - It's usually not just about getting paid more elsewhere. These are people who are dedicated and loyal to their work but feel unrecognized = a failure in management.
> 2. Your first reaction to their resignation  
>     - If you don't handle it well, you'll only confirm their feeling that they're not important, making it much harder to turn things around!
>     - Let them speak, but don't argue. They've probably spent sleepless nights practicing what to say.
> 3. Competent people have influence
>     - Other employees respect them and identify with them. As a result, other talented employees may want to follow their lead.

## If I get the responsibility to promote someone, make sure to reread Chapter 31 of Peter Drucker's "Management Cases".

> 많은 사람들이 간과하는 것 같은데, CTO는 회사의 경영자다. CTO가 하는 결정은 기술적인게 아니라 비즈니스적인것이어야 하고, 한편으로는 회사의 다른 비즈니스적인 결정에 기술적인 시야를 제공할 수 있어야한다.

> 그렇기에 내가 경계하는 것은 비즈니스적인 임팩트를 고려하지 않고 기술적으로 옳은 일을 하려고 하는 것과, 비즈니스가 기술적인 위험에 노출되도록 방치하는 것이다.

> 이번 연도의 남은 기간에 단 하나의 일만 할 수 있다면 무슨 일을 하시겠습니까? 그 일을 선택한 이유는요?

> 우리가 지금 하고 있지는 않은데 시급히 해야만 하는 일이 하나 있다면, 그것은 무엇일까요?
