# Unusual Challenges

This book originally written in Korean.

> At some point, the phrase `Get it done(해내세요)` became a team mantra. ... It was an expression of the belief that nothing is impossible, it's just a matter of willpower and execution.
> To a teammate who was making excuses, `Get it done` meant don't make excuses. To a teammate who was working toward an unattainable goal, `Get it done` was a cheer.
>
> – p 91
