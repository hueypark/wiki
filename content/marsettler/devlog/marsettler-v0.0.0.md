A catastrophic accident has struck the Mars outpost. Communication with Earth is completely severed. Only a handful of survivors remain.

Marsettler is a simulation where players shape the story of these survivors. Your journey becomes a narrative—a story worth sharing.

## What's in v0.0.0

- Autonomous AI: Characters find iron mines, extract ore, and haul it to the warehouse on their own
- Behavior Tree System: The architecture powering AI decision-making
- Resource Management: Mines deplete and disappear when exhausted
