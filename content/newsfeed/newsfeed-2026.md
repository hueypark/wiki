## [The Economic Intervention That Stops Engineer Attrition by Lloyd](https://codegood.co/writing/the-economic-intervention-that-stops-engineer-attrition)

> Option B wins every time—until it does not. Until a critical system fails during a product launch. Until you lose five senior engineers in eighteen months and the CFO start/s asking why you're spending $1.4 million annually to rehire for preventable problems.

> # Six Interventions That Work
>
> 1. Cost-of-Attrition Accounting
> 2. Trace Incidents Back to Ignored Warnings
> 3. Executive On-Call Rotation
> 4. Retention Metrics in Executive Compensation
> 5. Technical Advisory Board with Authority
> 6. Individual Contributor Track with Compensation Parity

## [Go's synctest is amazing by Eric Chiang](https://oblique.security/blog/go-synctest/)

> The main headline for Go 1.25’s synctest is its ability to magically advance time. Tests run in a “bubble” with a fake clock and calls to time.Sleep are virtualized, causing them to seem to run instantly:

> synctest is about blocking

## [Detecting goroutine leaks with synctest/pprof by Anton Zhiyanov](https://antonz.org/detecting-goroutine-leaks/)

> Leak detection algorithm
> 
> This goroutineleak profile uses the garbage collector's marking phase to find goroutines that are permanently blocked (leaked). The approach is explained in detail in the proposal and the paper by Saioc et al. — check it out if you're interested.

## [The Strengths of the `weak` Package: Weak Pointers Arrive in Go by Sam Burns](https://youtu.be/DbSQX0ERrp0?list=PLDWZ5uzn69ewrYyHTNrXlrWVDjLiOX0Yb)

> ### Benefirts of a Weak Cache
>
> - Cache itself does not prevent garbage collection
> - Memory-efficient caching without manual eviction
> - Simpler cache logic than manual eviction:
>   check weak pointer -> reload if nil

## [I Stopped Reading Code. My Code Reviews Got Better. by Kieran Klaassen](https://every.to/source-code/i-stopped-reading-code-my-code-reviews-got-better)

> The 50/50 rule

It's an important document for next month's executive meeting. Let me know anytime if you run into difficulties. But it must be completed."

## [The coding interview by Jay Gengelbach](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaygengelbach_i-conducted-200-interviews-for-google-in-activity-7413777107685879808-tAtg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABSjspgBLaworIQjzZyO5CJmXIsDApO0tOU)

> My fear is that the reaction will be to stop leaning on interviewing. The flawed assessment mechanism will fall back to even-more-flawed reputation networks: "who you know, not what you know."

> Comment by By Jochen Mader: The whole FAANG interview process was aimed at giving the interviewers a sense of superiority. I coached several people through them and sat to the side during the phone calls with your weird riddles and random big O questions.
