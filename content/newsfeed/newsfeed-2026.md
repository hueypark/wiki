## [The coding interview by Jay Gengelbach](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jaygengelbach_i-conducted-200-interviews-for-google-in-activity-7413777107685879808-tAtg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABSjspgBLaworIQjzZyO5CJmXIsDApO0tOU)

> My fear is that the reaction will be to stop leaning on interviewing. The flawed assessment mechanism will fall back to even-more-flawed reputation networks: "who you know, not what you know."

> Comment by By Jochen Mader: The whole FAANG interview process was aimed at giving the interviewers a sense of superiority. I coached several people through them and sat to the side during the phone calls with your weird riddles and random big O questions.
