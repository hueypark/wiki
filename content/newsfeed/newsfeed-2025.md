> We’ll walk through how we got here, what the Shared Catalog unlocks, and how this powers stateless compute over anything, including data lakes.

## [🤔 자기개발 안하면 시간낭비다?? 에 대한 솔직한 생각 털어보기 (4K) by 조승연의 탐구생활](https://youtu.be/AqEN8qOcAcA)

## [The Service-as-Software Gold Rush by Glenn Clayton](https://www.glennclayton.me/my-blog/the-service-as-software-gold-rush)

> However, as the quoted text suggests, if the key factor in development productivity with AI tools ultimately lies in the competence of the developers using them, then we need to discuss what kind of competence that is, how it can be improved, how AI tools can contribute to enhancing that competence, and how much learning productivity—not just development productivity—can be increased in the process.

## [Immediate Decisions by Kihong Bae](https://www.thestartupbible.com/2025/06/making-immediate-decisions-on-the-fly.html)

> Another reason people struggle to make immediate decisions isn’t excessive caution, but rather the discomfort and unease that comes with making the decision itself.

> In these situations, the worst decision a CEO can make is to say, "Let’s wait another week and see."

> Finally, to be honest, there are no decisions in this world that truly require that much deliberation. In my experience, most decisions can be made within five minutes.

> When I told someone from headquarters that I had returned, they didn't ask any questions and simply said, "Thanks for coming back." Then they immediately moved on to the next topic. That day, I kept thinking about those words. My heart felt warm, I was glad I came back, and I felt motivated to do even better going forward.

## [Taking a step back by Jaana Dogan](https://x.com/rakyll/status/1934478708108394708)

> When you work for 12+ hours a day, you become too obsessed about what you are building. Obsessions somewhat end up being defeating because pivoting frequently is the most important tool. Taking a step back from time to time is actually useful.

## [Multiple GCP products are experiencing Service issues](https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/ow5i3PPK96RduMcb1SsW)

> Incident began at 2025-06-12 10:51 and ended at 2025-06-12 18:18 (all times are US/Pacific).

> Summary
>
> Google Cloud, Google Workspace and Google Security Operations products experienced increased 503 errors in external API requests, impacting customers.
>
> We deeply apologize for the impact this outage has had. Google Cloud customers and their users trust their businesses to Google, and we will do better. We apologize for the impact this has had not only on our customers’ businesses and their users but also on the trust of our systems. We are committed to making improvements to help avoid outages like this moving forward.
>
> What happened?
>
> Google and Google Cloud APIs are served through our Google API management and control planes. Distributed regionally, these management and control planes are responsible for ensuring each API request that comes in is authorized, has the policy and appropriate checks (like quota) to meet their endpoints. The core binary that is part of this policy check system is known as Service Control. Service Control is a regional service that has a regional datastore that it reads quota and policy information from. This datastore metadata gets replicated almost instantly globally to manage quota policies for Google Cloud and our customers.
>
> On May 29, 2025, a new feature was added to Service Control for additional quota policy checks. This code change and binary release went through our region by region rollout, but the code path that failed was never exercised during this rollout due to needing a policy change that would trigger the code. As a safety precaution, this code change came with a red-button to turn off that particular policy serving path. The issue with this change was that it did not have appropriate error handling nor was it feature flag protected. Without the appropriate error handling, the null pointer caused the binary to crash. Feature flags are used to gradually enable the feature region by region per project, starting with internal projects, to enable us to catch issues. If this had been flag protected, the issue would have been caught in staging.
>
> On June 12, 2025 at ~10:45am PDT, a policy change was inserted into the regional Spanner tables that Service Control uses for policies. Given the global nature of quota management, this metadata was replicated globally within seconds. This policy data contained unintended blank fields. Service Control, then regionally exercised quota checks on policies in each regional datastore. This pulled in blank fields for this respective policy change and exercised the code path that hit the null pointer causing the binaries to go into a crash loop. This occurred globally given each regional deployment.
>
> Within 2 minutes, our Site Reliability Engineering team was triaging the incident. Within 10 minutes, the root cause was identified and the red-button (to disable the serving path) was being put in place. The red-button was ready to roll out ~25 minutes from the start of the incident. Within 40 minutes of the incident, the red-button rollout was completed, and we started seeing recovery across regions, starting with the smaller ones first.
>
> Within some of our larger regions, such as us-central-1, as Service Control tasks restarted, it created a herd effect on the underlying infrastructure it depends on (i.e. that Spanner table), overloading the infrastructure. Service Control did not have the appropriate randomized exponential backoff implemented to avoid this. It took up to ~2h 40 mins to fully resolve in us-central-1 as we throttled task creation to minimize the impact on the underlying infrastructure and routed traffic to multi-regional databases to reduce the load. At that point, Service Control and API serving was fully recovered across all regions. Corresponding Google and Google Cloud products started recovering with some taking longer depending upon their architecture.

## [Building a Distributed Cache for S3 by Tom Schreiber](https://clickhouse.com/blog/building-a-distributed-cache-for-s3)

> Stage 1: Local OS page cache
> Stage 2: Local cache on cloud compute nodes
> Stage 3: The distributed cache

> That’s why latency becomes the dominant bottleneck in many real-world analytical queries. You simply can’t fan out enough I/O to hide the delay.
>
> - Short-running queries often touch just a few compressed blocks.
> - Scattered access patterns involve many small, disjoint reads.
>
> In both cases, bandwidth doesn’t help, latency is the limit.

| Layer   | Latency    | IOPS   | Throughput         |
|---------|------------|--------|--------------------|
| S3      | 500 ms     | 5K     | 2 GB/sec           |
| SSD     | 1 ms       | 100K   | 4 GB/sec           |
| Memory  | 250 ns     | 100M   | 100 GB/sec         |
| Network | 100–250 µs |        | 1.5–12.5 GB/sec    |

> Thanks to these characteristics, the distributed cache, accessed over the network, delivers latencies that fall neatly between SSD and memory. And like the local filesystem cache before it, it solves the core bottleneck of object storage: latency.
