## [`Whole world richer` by Jeff Bezos](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxs0NJswhYwv-h0aiJl_0igPlHJ-g47MBU?si=N9_LdQP50ju1yoMP)

> What does cost reduction really mean? It means inventing a better way.
> Right, and when you invent a better way, you make the whole world richer.
> So, you know, whatever it was, I don't know how many thousands of years ago, somebody invented the plow.
> And when they invented the plow, they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive.
> And so it is a big deal to invent better ways. That's how the world gets richer.
