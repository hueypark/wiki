## [Every team will have conflict - 4 stages of team development by Hyunsol Park](https://dis.qa/zmorXAU)

> Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing

Right guide for forming a team.

Tasks should be assigned in much greater detail for each role, goal, and process, with the goal of communicating
frequently and gaining understanding through task performance.

Spend much more time explaining roles, goals, and processes with the expectation that they won't ask questions or voice
their opinions until they feel comfortable, and actively check in with them to see if they don't understand or need
clarification. Intentionally do a lot of activities to create a sense of security and bonding.

## [멘토링 이야기 #14 퇴사의 기술을 알고 싶습니다. by Keeyong H.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7164878318226300928-fWOn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

> 1. 그만두기로 결정했다면 (즉 무슨 카운터 오퍼를 지금 회사에서 주더라도 그만둘 생각이라면) 먼저 매니저와 이야기를 시작해서 마지막 날 정하고 내 일을 누가 대신 할지 정한다. 특별한 이유가 없는한 2주가 딱 좋은 것 같다. 하지만 당장 일을 대신할 사람을 찾기 힘든 곳이라면 시간을 더 여유있게 잡지만 한달 이상은 너무 길다고 본다.

> 2. 어떤 메시지를 퇴사 이유로 보낼 것인지 먼저 바로 위 매니저와 이야기한다. 최대한 솔직하되 어떤 메시지를 전달할 것인지 매니저가 아는 것이 여러모로 좋고 그 메시지에 충실하게 모두에게 이야기하는 것이 좋다. 즉 사람에 따라 말을 바꾸지 않는다. 앞에서 이야기했던 것처럼 되도록이면 감정적인 메시지를 전달하지 않는다. 감정적인 메시지 밖에 생각이 안 난다면 상처가 있다는 증거니 상처를 분명히 인지하고 치유하는 노력을 병행하는 것이 다음 직장에서 잘 하는데 도움이 된다. 안 그러면 상처와 분노를 그대로 들고 새 직장에서 시작할 가능성이 높다.

Ensure consistency in your message regarding the reason for your departure, regardless of the individual.

## [Result and process by @lqez](https://twitter.com/lqez/status/1759793856437276902)

> 결과물을 우아하게 하는 일에 집중하는 사람과 과정을 우아하게 하는 일에 집중하는 사람 둘 다 모두 대단한 사람이라고 본다.
> 많은 사람들은 둘 다 신경쓰지 않고 적당히 하거나 둘 다 신경쓰느라 한 발자국 내딛기도 힘들어 했다.

I'm all about getting results.

## [`Whole world richer` by Jeff Bezos](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxs0NJswhYwv-h0aiJl_0igPlHJ-g47MBU?si=N9_LdQP50ju1yoMP)

> What does cost reduction really mean? It means inventing a better way.
> Right, and when you invent a better way, you make the whole world richer.
> So, you know, whatever it was, I don't know how many thousands of years ago, somebody invented the plow.
> And when they invented the plow, they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive.
> And so it is a big deal to invent better ways. That's how the world gets richer.
