# January 2024

## [2023-04부터 실천중인 스프린트 기반의 팀 업무 프레임워크](https://johngrib.github.io/wiki/better-work/2023/04-scrum-sprint/)

> - 회의록을 작성한다
> - 회의 목표를 정하고 시작한다
> - 목표를 달성하면 회의를 빨리 끝낸다

- Write the meeting notes
- Set the goal of the meeting and start
- End the meeting as soon as the goal is achieved

> 만약 정보전달성 회의라면 가급적 회의를 하지 말고 이메일이나 문서로 공유한다.

If it is an information transfer meeting, it is better not to have a meeting and share it by email or document.

## [`Whole world richer` by Jeff Bezos](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxs0NJswhYwv-h0aiJl_0igPlHJ-g47MBU?si=N9_LdQP50ju1yoMP)

> What does cost reduction really mean? It means inventing a better way.
> Right, and when you invent a better way, you make the whole world richer.
> So, you know, whatever it was, I don't know how many thousands of years ago, somebody invented the plow.
> And when they invented the plow, they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive.
> And so it is a big deal to invent better ways. That's how the world gets richer.
