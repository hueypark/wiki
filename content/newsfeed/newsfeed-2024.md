## [Intervention in game design undermines the designer's ownership by Woojin Kim](https://blog.woojinkim.org/intervention-in-game-design-destroys-designer-ownership)

> Designs that are created with one's own ownership are better able to handle the difficulties of the development process.
> If the outcome differs from the initial intention, they can adapt accordingly.
> This process will undoubtedly help the individual grow and become a reliable teammate for the next project.
> However, if someone loses their ownership and exhausts themselves trying to achieve the intended result, they might lose the opportunity to work together again in the future.
> I believe the former situation is preferable.

> more often and more deeply that will have the biggest impact on your ability to deliver your desired output and create impact.
> If communication is sporadic, it's only when things go wrong that you realize, "Oh. Nobody is doing what I want them to do".

## [2017 Letter to Shareholders by Jeffrey P. Bezos](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2017-letter-to-shareholders)

> Intrinsic or Teachable?
>
> First, there’s a foundational question: are high standards intrinsic or teachable?
> If you take me on your basketball team, you can teach me many things, but you can’t teach me to be taller.
> Do we first and foremost need to select for “high standards” people?
> If so, this letter would need to be mostly about hiring practices, but I don’t think so.
> I believe high standards are teachable.
> In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure.
> High standards are contagious.
> Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they’ll quickly adapt.
> The opposite is also true.
> If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread.
> And though exposure works well to teach high standards,
> I believe you can accelerate that rate of learning by articulating a few core principles of high standards,
> which I hope to share in this letter.

## [Shareholder letter 1998 by Jeffrey P. Bezos](https://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter98.pdf)

> During our hiring meetings, we ask people to consider three questions before making a decision:
>
> - Will you admire this person? If you think about the people you’ve admired in
> your life, they are probably people you’ve been able to learn from or take an
> example from. For myself, I’ve always tried hard to work only with people I
> admire, and I encourage folks here to be just as demanding. Life is definitely too
> short to do otherwise.
> - Will this person raise the average level of effectiveness of the group they’re
> entering? We want to fight entropy. The bar has to continuously go up. I ask
> people to visualize the company 5 years from now. At that point, each of us
> should look around and say, “The standards are so high now -- boy, I’m glad I got
> in when I did!”
> - Along what dimension might this person be a superstar? Many people have
> unique skills, interests, and perspectives that enrich the work environment for all
> of us. It’s often something that’s not even related to their jobs. One person here
> is a National Spelling Bee champion (1978, I believe). I suspect it doesn’t help
> her in her everyday work, but it does make working here more fun if you can
> occasionally snag her in the hall with a quick challenge: “onomatopoeia!”

## [Every team will have conflict - 4 stages of team development by Hyunsol Park](https://dis.qa/zmorXAU)

> Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing

Right guide for forming a team.

Tasks should be assigned in much greater detail for each role, goal, and process, with the goal of communicating
frequently and gaining understanding through task performance.

Spend much more time explaining roles, goals, and processes with the expectation that they won't ask questions or voice
their opinions until they feel comfortable, and actively check in with them to see if they don't understand or need
clarification. Intentionally do a lot of activities to create a sense of security and bonding.

> 1. 그만두기로 결정했다면 (즉 무슨 카운터 오퍼를 지금 회사에서 주더라도 그만둘 생각이라면) 먼저 매니저와 이야기를 시작해서 마지막 날 정하고 내 일을 누가 대신 할지 정한다. 특별한 이유가 없는한 2주가 딱 좋은 것 같다. 하지만 당장 일을 대신할 사람을 찾기 힘든 곳이라면 시간을 더 여유있게 잡지만 한달 이상은 너무 길다고 본다.

> 2. 어떤 메시지를 퇴사 이유로 보낼 것인지 먼저 바로 위 매니저와 이야기한다. 최대한 솔직하되 어떤 메시지를 전달할 것인지 매니저가 아는 것이 여러모로 좋고 그 메시지에 충실하게 모두에게 이야기하는 것이 좋다. 즉 사람에 따라 말을 바꾸지 않는다. 앞에서 이야기했던 것처럼 되도록이면 감정적인 메시지를 전달하지 않는다. 감정적인 메시지 밖에 생각이 안 난다면 상처가 있다는 증거니 상처를 분명히 인지하고 치유하는 노력을 병행하는 것이 다음 직장에서 잘 하는데 도움이 된다. 안 그러면 상처와 분노를 그대로 들고 새 직장에서 시작할 가능성이 높다.

Ensure consistency in your message regarding the reason for your departure, regardless of the individual.

## [`Whole world richer` by Jeff Bezos](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxs0NJswhYwv-h0aiJl_0igPlHJ-g47MBU?si=N9_LdQP50ju1yoMP)

> What does cost reduction really mean? It means inventing a better way.
> Right, and when you invent a better way, you make the whole world richer.
> So, you know, whatever it was, I don't know how many thousands of years ago, somebody invented the plow.
> And when they invented the plow, they made the whole world richer because they made farming less expensive.
> And so it is a big deal to invent better ways. That's how the world gets richer.
