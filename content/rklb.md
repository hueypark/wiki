> Summary
>
> - Rocket Lab is a high-potential space company led by visionary CEO Peter Beck, expanding into defense and satellite markets.
> - RKLB posted record Q2 revenue of $144M, up 36% YoY, and is executing well on contracts, including a $515M Space Development Agency project.
> - The upcoming Neutron rocket launch is a major catalyst, but repeated delays and high expectations create significant short-term risk for the stock.
