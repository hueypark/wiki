# Reflections on Career Advancement: Understanding the Power of Relationships and Reputation

1. Anyone can become a Director by working hard enough. To become a Sr. Director, someone needs to push you. To become a VP, several people need to pull for you.
2. Check job postings weekly and ensure you have at least one job interview a year.
3. Almost no one applying for a certain position lacks the qualifications. People who can hardly go wrong even if chosen with eyes closed are the ones who get the interview opportunities. Eventually, those slightly more familiar tend to get selected.
4. In the same context, office politics is merely about forming relationships, and there's no need to view it negatively.
5. There's no great significance in judging the right and wrong of office politics. Even if you don't participate, everyone else does.
6. Working hard and performing well is a given; promotion relies on relationships and reputation.
