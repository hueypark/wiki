## [Things to watch out for when expanding team size by Seunghoon Lee (Translated from Korean)](https://brunch.co.kr/@seunghoon82/681)

> 1. Speed (e.g., product update speed, new technology development/launch speed, etc.) must increase compared to the past. (The idea that speed can slow down for the sake of stability and structure is 99% wrong. You must add stability and structure while making things even faster.)
>
> 2. Per capita productivity must increase. In other words, revenue growth should outpace the rate at which new people are added.
>
> 3. Limit additional hires per quarter (or half-year) to within 10% of the total headcount. If a 30-person organization grows to 60 in just six months, problems will arise. The most thought and discussion should go into whether to open a new position, not just during interviews. You should spend more time and energy deciding whether to open a position than interviewing candidates. The discussion should be so rigorous that you might even say, "Let's just not hire anyone."
