## [When do VCs start seriously thinking about exits? by Demo Day (Translated from Korean)](https://youtu.be/rE9M41meI2M)

> For VCs, exits are not about "greed" but a "structural inevitability."
>
> As a founder, you must always check the 'fund maturity date' of your VC.

# Human Resources

## [Things to watch out for when expanding team size by Seunghoon Lee (Translated from Korean)](https://brunch.co.kr/@seunghoon82/681)

> 1. Speed (e.g., product update speed, new technology development/launch speed, etc.) must increase compared to the past. (The idea that speed can slow down for the sake of stability and structure is 99% wrong. You must add stability and structure while making things even faster.)
>
> 2. Per capita productivity must increase. In other words, revenue growth should outpace the rate at which new people are added.
>
> 3. Limit additional hires per quarter (or half-year) to within 10% of the total headcount. If a 30-person organization grows to 60 in just six months, problems will arise. The most thought and discussion should go into whether to open a new position, not just during interviews. You should spend more time and energy deciding whether to open a position than interviewing candidates. The discussion should be so rigorous that you might even say, "Let's just not hire anyone."

# Mergers and Acquisitions

## [[M&A Case Study] London Bagel Museum: Strategy Behind the 200 Billion KRW F&B Brand Sale by 강혜미 (Translated from Korean)](https://star-law.kr/knowledge/londonbagel_case/)

> JKL initially offered approximately 150 billion KRW (4.5x EBITDA) as a realistic starting point and entered negotiations.
> They then precisely assessed the situation of both the founder and the seller to execute their negotiation strategy.
> The deal was ultimately closed at around mid-200 billion KRW, approximately 8x EBITDA.
> This significantly exceeds the domestic F&B industry average of 3-5x, meaning a valuation at the level of global premium brands was applied.

> Private equity funds prefer F&B companies due to relatively low technological barriers and the potential for rapid value appreciation.
