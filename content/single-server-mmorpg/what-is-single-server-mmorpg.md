What is a single server MMORPG?

Before I begin, let's clarify the concept of what we're going to talk.

<!--more-->

I'll skip the RPG part. I don't think it'll be a big problem. If you're more curious, look at [Wikipedia's definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game).

Next is MMO(G). MMO(G) stands for a `Massively multiplayer online game`, and Wikipedia explains it as follows.

> A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG, or more commonly, MMO) is an online game with large numbers of players, often hundreds or thousands, on the same server.[^1]

But hundreds or thousands is too broad. And it's not a good explanation in terms of game design and engineering. Let's specify this value a bit more by talking about a single server. The single server means that all users are logically on the same server. Although real-world machines and software have physical limitations, eventually, all users can meet and interact.

So what is a single server MMORPG? It will depend on the game's design and engineering capabilities, but I think the following is sufficient.

* About one thousand users can interact simultaneously on one physical node
* Movement between physical nodes must be freely possible
